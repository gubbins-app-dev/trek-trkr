    <h1>Privacy Policy for "Club Fee Tracker" App</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 08, 2025</p>

    <p>Gubbins App Development © is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application (“App”). By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined here.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>While the App does not collect any personally identifiable information directly, it uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. Google AdMob may collect certain data automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (such as IDFA)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>General device information (model, OS version)</li>
        <li>App interaction and engagement data</li>
        <li>Diagnostic and performance data</li>
        <li>Approximate location (via network data)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data collection is performed solely by Google. For information on how Google uses this data, see their policies:</p>
    <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Privacy & Terms – Advertising</a></p>

    <h2>2. Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or account details. The App has no account system and requires no registration.</p>

    <h2>3. Usage Data</h2>
    <p>Other than data processed by Google AdMob, the App does not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics data</li>
        <li>Browsing or interaction logs</li>
        <li>Crash logs</li>
        <li>Custom device metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or share any data ourselves. Google may collect and process data for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ad delivery</li>
        <li>Ad personalisation (if permitted)</li>
        <li>Fraud prevention</li>
        <li>Ad performance measurement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Gubbins App Development does not access or control this data.</p>

    <h2>5. Advertising and User Choices</h2>
    <p>Ads in the App are provided by Google AdMob. Users can manage ad tracking and preferences via:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking</li>
        <li>Google ad settings (region dependent)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you disable tracking, ads may still appear but will not be personalised.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store personal data, so there are no risks related to handling such data. Google AdMob processes its own data under its security standards. Users should protect their devices with standard precautions.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. AdMob is configured to comply with child-appropriate policies when applicable.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App, third-party services, or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here, and the Effective Date will be revised accordingly.</p>
